# Using Python to Create a Program that Handles number of hours per week

This program will be able to count and track number of hours for each employee weekly. I plan to implement this using TKinter and having the program access the information from a local file that can be edited so that it "saves".It probably won't be as practical as using a google sheet or an excel sheet,but it will be fun practice.
