# Using Python to Create a Program that Handles number of hours per week and scheduling

This program will allow the user to plan out the shifts of employees per day of the week. It's not super automated but it saves this information to a file that gets updated through the use of a       button. I plan to implement this using TKinter and having the program access the information from a local file that can be edited so that it "saves". It probably won't be as practical as using a google sheet or an excel sheet,but it will be fun practice.

The goal is to also have a page where you can write and store the number of hours per week per employee and possibly even have the "software" do a little math totalling.

@Version 05/21/22
Project can create a tkinter window.

@Version 06/27/22
Project creates the window with a label and a horizontally scrolling text box that can be exited. The project also spawns the textbox with the contents of a savefile called saveFile.txt
